    <h2>CSS</h2>
    <p> have removed a recently-added paragraph from the Declaration block section. This is overly detailed for that section, which describes various kinds of property value in general terms, it should not go into specifics. There are many more values than are given here as examples.

        Regarding the weasel-phrase "At some point", that would be CSS Color Module Level 4, which as of 28 April 2022 is still a W3C Working Draft, and therefore not finalised. Some of the relevant sections are: 5.2. The RGB hexadecimal notations: #RRGGBB; 4.8. Serializing <color> Values; 5. sRGB Colors. --Redrose64 ðŸŒ¹ (talk) 05:51, 18 May 2022 (UTC)</p>
